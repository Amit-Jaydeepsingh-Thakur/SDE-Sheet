The composition is the stricter form of aggregation. Like Book and Library.
The Library cannot exist without the books. So if Books is destroyed then the Library is also not there.

In the aggregation is also the kind of the has a relationship where we can refer to the other classes as well

eg: -

class Address {
  String add;
}

Class Person {
  String fname;
  Address ass;        // usage of aggregation
}
